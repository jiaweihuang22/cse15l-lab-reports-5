I am having a problem fixing the bug in ListExamples.java. By running `bash test.sh` I know there's a bug I need to change but I can't figure out which part of the code I need to change.

The hint that I can give you is the list the result is being stored in. Think about what list it should be stored in when it's the number behind it is 1 or 2.

Thank you so much. I have found the bug. The list it is being stored in is index1 when the command is getting results from list 2. Therefore, I only need to change the list from index1 to index2.
